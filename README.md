# AguilaServer

Aguila is an advice platform for college students to anonymously ask questions to their peers. Our research shows that many students are afraid to ask for help or they don’t think anyone can. Sometimes they feel as if they’re the only one in the world with their problems and that’s just not true. If these students use Aguila, they can get the help they need. They can know that they have a community where they feel they belong; that there is a world of people out there who have gone through the same things and don’t want anyone to suffer the way they did.
